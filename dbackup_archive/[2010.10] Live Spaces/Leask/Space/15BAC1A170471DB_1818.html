<br />Isaac Asimov, who, in my opinion, is a great writer, published his three laws in a short story called &quot;Runaround&quot; in 1942. The laws are about robots and human being.
<br />The three laws were stated as follows&#58;
<br />
<br />1. A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
<br />2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
<br />3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
<br />
<br />&quot;i.Robot&quot;, the story is also from Isaac Asimov, is amazing but it will be real, I think.</div><h3>Comments</h3><div id="bp-15BAC1A170471DB_1818-comments" class="comments"></div></div></body></html>
