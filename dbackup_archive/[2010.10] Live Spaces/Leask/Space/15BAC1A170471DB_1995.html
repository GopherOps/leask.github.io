<br />Welcome to Macenstein’s“Mac Chick of the Month”.
<br />
<br />Each month we will be featuring a different die-hard, Mac-loving girl who is (almost) as well designed as the Apple products they love.
We are very excited to kick of this new monthly feature with the lovely Christina, an award winning freelance sound designer and long-time Apple fan.

<br />Christina is a recent graduate of the Berklee College of Music in Boston where she majored in Music Synthesis.
During her tenure at Berklee, Christina received Berklee’s Laurie Anderson Women in Music Technology Award for excellence within her major.
