<br />I´m loving living every single day but sometimes I feel so....
<br />I hope to find a little peace of mind and I just want to know.
<br />
<br />And who can heal those tiny broken hearts, and what are we to be. Where is home on the milkyway of stars, I dry my eyes again.
<br />Refrain&#58;
<br />In my Dreams I´m not so far away from home
<br />What am I in a world so far away from home
<br />All my life all the time so far away from home
<br />without you I´ll be so far away from home.
<br />
<br />Strophe II
<br />If we could make it thrue the darkest Night we´d have a brighter day.The world I see beyond your pretty eyes, makes me want to stay.
<br />And who can heal those tiny broken hearts, and what are we to be. Where is home on the milkyway of stars, I dry my eyes again.
<br />Refrain&#58;
<br />In my Dreams I´m not so far away from home
<br />What am I in a world so far away from home
<br />All my life all the timeso far away from home
<br />without you I´ll be so far away from home.
<br />
<br />Strophe III
<br />I count on you, no matter what they say, cause love can find it´s time. I hope to be a part of you again, baby let us shine.
<br />And who can heal those tiny broken hearts, and what are we to be. Where is home on the milkyway of stars, I dry my eyes again.
<br />Refrain&#58;
<br />In my Dreams I´m not so far away from home
<br />What am I in a world so far away from home
<br />All my life all the time so far away from home
<br />without you I´ll be so far away from home.
<br />
<br />In my Dreams I´m not so far away from home
<br />What am I in a world so far away from home
<br />All my life all the time so far away from home
<br />without you I´´ll be so far away from home.
