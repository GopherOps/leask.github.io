<br />I know I can be a little stubborn sometimes 
<br />You might say, a little righteous and too proud 
<br />I just want to find a way to compromise 
<br />Cause I believe that we can work things out 
<br />
<br />I thought I had all the answers never giving in 
<br />But baby since you've gone I admit that I was wrong 
<br />
<br />All I know is I'm lost without you, I'm not gonna lie 
<br />How am I going to be strong without you I need you by my side  
<br />If we ever say we'd never be together and we ended with goodbye don't know what I'd do? 
<br />I'm lost without you 
<br />I keep trying to find my way but all I know is I'm lost without you 
<br />I keep trying to face the day I'm lost without you 
<br />
<br />How am I ever gonna get rid of these blues 
<br />Baby I'm so lonely all the time 
<br />Everywhere I go I get so confused 
<br />You're the only thing that's on my mind 
<br />
<br />Oh my bed's so cold at night and I miss you more each day 
<br />Only you can make it right no I'm not too proud to say 
<br />
<br />All I know is I'm lost without you I'm not gonna lie 
<br />How am I going to be strong without you I need you by my side  
<br />If we ever say we'd never be together and we ended with goodbye don't know what I'd do?
<br />I'm lost without you 
<br />I keep trying to find my way but all I know is I'm lost without you 
<br />I keep trying to face the day I'm lost without you 
<br />
<br />If I could only hold you now and make the pain just go away 
<br />Can't stop the tears from running down my face 
<br />Oh 
<br />
<br />All I know is I'm lost without you I'm not gonna lie 
<br />How am I going to be strong without you I need you by my side  
<br />If we ever say we'd never be together and we ended with goodbye don't know what I'd do?
<br />I'm lost without you
<br />I keep trying to find my way but all I know is I'm lost without you 
<br />I keep trying to face the day and all I know is I'm lost without your love
<br />I'm lost without you woah
