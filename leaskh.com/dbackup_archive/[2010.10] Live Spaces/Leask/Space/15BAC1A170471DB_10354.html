Dear participant,<br />
<br />
During the past few weeks, 100+ judges around the world reviewed over<br />
1,700 applications.  They were extremely impressed with the diversity<br />
and the large number of high quality entries submitted.  It<br />
is clear that the number of great applications far exceeds the 50 top<br />
scoring applications that will move on to the final round of the<br />
Android Developer Challenge.<br />
<br />
We regret to inform you that your entry was not among the top 50<br />
submissions.  However, we'd like to bring a couple of interesting<br />
opportunities to your attention&#58;<br />
1. Due to the high quality of the submissions many<br />
of the judges who are also members of the Open Handset Alliance have<br />
showed interest in contacting some of the participants regarding their<br />
applications to explore further opportunities.<br />
2. In the near future, we'll be creating an Android Developer<br />
Challenge Gallery where you can showcase your application.  We'll be<br />
providing more details shortly on how you can participate in this<br />
gallery.<br />
<br />
If you're interested in either one of these opportunities, please fill<br />
out the following form&#58;<br />

<br />
As<br />
we've announced earlier, we'll be running a second Android Developer<br />
Challenge later this year.  This will give you another opportunity to<br />
showcase your application and compete for top prizes.  We'll be<br />
announcing the details of the second Android Developer Challenge in the<br />
near future.<br />
<br />
If you happen to be in San Francisco, CA on May 28-29, we hope that<br />
you'll join us at Google I/O,<br />
Google's largest developer event, where we will be holding many<br />
technical sessions on Android and other relevant technologies. The team<br />
will be present there and is looking forward to meeting you.<br />
<br />
Thank you again for participating in the challenge.<br />
Android Developer Challenge Team<br />
