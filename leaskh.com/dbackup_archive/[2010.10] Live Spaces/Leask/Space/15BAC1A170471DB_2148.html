<br />But now, I really want to do this.
<br />In fact I just need a very simple public system to post my writings and my pictures.
<br />Unfortunately I can't find a perfect one.
<br />I've tried so many blog systems but at last I have to disappoint.
<br />The major problem is all the blog systems can't work well with Mac OS.
<br />So I have to remove some modules from my Live Space because this same reason.
<br />I am so sorry if you are a M$ Windows user.
<br />I done this just because I want my pages show a same effect between Windows or Mac.</div><h3>Comments</h3><div id="bp-15BAC1A170471DB_2148-comments" class="comments"></div></div></body></html>
