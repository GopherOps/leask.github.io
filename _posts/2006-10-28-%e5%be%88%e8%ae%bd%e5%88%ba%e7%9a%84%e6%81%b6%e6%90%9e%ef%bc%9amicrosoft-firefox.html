<br &#47;>Microsoft(R) Firefox 2007 Professional<br />
<br &#47;>The new award-winning browser from Microsoft is now faster, securer and quicker anything else on the market. Why use anything else?<br />
<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;>Enjoy a Better Web Experience<br />
<br &#47;>MS Firefox 2007 delivers a dramatic boost in the download speeds of online pornography. By utilising a proprietary dynamic algorithm - anything that remotely resembles a tit or a boob will download up to 10 times faster. Fun at the speed of light!<br />
<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;>Stay Secure on the Web<br />
<br &#47;>Firefox 2007's new TakeOver(TM) technology protects the Windows Kernel by automatically recognizing all McAfee and Symantec programs as viruses. Downloading has never been safer.<br />
<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;>Interactive Multimedia<br />
<br &#47;>Microsoft's AKobe Phlash(TM) Plugin delivers awesome online interactive content; anything from music, videos to games. (Lawsuit from Adobe pending)<br />
