<div id="msgcns!15BAC1A170471DB!10354" class="bvMsg">
<div>和A-Qing合作参加的Google Android Developer Challenge开发大赛的结果如我们所料：我们并没有进入Round 1。<br &#47;><br />
Any way，发帖纪念一下曾经的辛勤劳动。<br &#47;><br />
A-Qing是个了不起的人，祝愿他以后有更大的发展！<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
以下是Google的回复：<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Dear participant,<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
During the past few weeks, 100+ judges around the world reviewed over<br &#47;><br />
1,700 applications. &nbsp;They were extremely impressed with the diversity<br &#47;><br />
and the large number of high quality entries submitted. &nbsp;It<br &#47;><br />
is clear that the number of great applications far exceeds the 50 top<br &#47;><br />
scoring applications that will move on to the final round of the<br &#47;><br />
Android Developer Challenge.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
We regret to inform you that your entry was not among the top 50<br &#47;><br />
submissions. &nbsp;However, we'd like to bring a couple of interesting<br &#47;><br />
opportunities to your attention:<br &#47;><br />
1. Due to the high quality of the submissions many<br &#47;><br />
of the judges who are also members of the Open Handset Alliance have<br &#47;><br />
showed interest in contacting some of the participants regarding their<br &#47;><br />
applications to explore further opportunities.<br &#47;><br />
2. In the near future, we'll be creating an Android Developer<br &#47;><br />
Challenge Gallery where you can showcase your application. &nbsp;We'll be<br &#47;><br />
providing more details shortly on how you can participate in this<br &#47;><br />
gallery.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
If you're interested in either one of these opportunities, please fill<br &#47;><br />
out the following form:<br &#47;><br />
<a href="https:&#47;&#47;spreadsheets.google.com&#47;a&#47;google.com&#47;viewform?key=pyVGDjmAX3cmEanOhJkhFcw" target="_blank">https:&#47;&#47;spreadsheets.google.com&#47;a&#47;google.com&#47;viewform?key=pyVGDjmAX3cmEanOhJkhFcw<&#47;a><br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
As<br &#47;><br />
we've announced earlier, we'll be running a second Android Developer<br &#47;><br />
Challenge later this year. &nbsp;This will give you another opportunity to<br &#47;><br />
showcase your application and compete for top prizes. &nbsp;We'll be<br &#47;><br />
announcing the details of the second Android Developer Challenge in the<br &#47;><br />
near future.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
If you happen to be in San Francisco, CA on May 28-29, we hope that<br &#47;><br />
you'll join us at Google I&#47;O,<br &#47;><br />
Google's largest developer event, where we will be holding many<br &#47;><br />
technical sessions on Android and other relevant technologies. The team<br &#47;><br />
will be present there and is looking forward to meeting you.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Thank you again for participating in the challenge.<br &#47;><br />
Android Developer Challenge Team<br &#47;><br />
