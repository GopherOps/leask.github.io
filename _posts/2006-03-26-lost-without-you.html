<br &#47;>I know I can be a little stubborn sometimes<br />
<br &#47;>You might say, a little righteous and too proud<br />
<br &#47;>I just want to find a way to compromise<br />
<br &#47;>Cause I believe that we can work things out<br />
<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;>I thought I had all the answers never giving in<br />
<br &#47;>But baby since you've gone I admit that I was wrong<br />
<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;>All I know is I'm lost without you, I'm not gonna lie<br />
<br &#47;>How am I going to be strong without you I need you by my side<br />
<br &#47;>If we ever say we'd never be together and we ended with goodbye don't know what I'd do?<br />
<br &#47;>I'm lost without you<br />
<br &#47;>I keep trying to find my way but all I know is I'm lost without you<br />
<br &#47;>I keep trying to face the day I'm lost without you<br />
<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;>How am I ever gonna get rid of these blues<br />
<br &#47;>Baby I'm so lonely all the time<br />
<br &#47;>Everywhere I go I get so confused<br />
<br &#47;>You're the only thing that's on my mind<br />
<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;>Oh my bed's so cold at night and I miss you more each day<br />
<br &#47;>Only you can make it right no I'm not too proud to say<br />
<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;>All I know is I'm lost without you I'm not gonna lie<br />
<br &#47;>How am I going to be strong without you I need you by my side<br />
<br &#47;>If we ever say we'd never be together and we ended with goodbye don't know what I'd do?<br />
<br &#47;>I'm lost without you<br />
<br &#47;>I keep trying to find my way but all I know is I'm lost without you<br />
<br &#47;>I keep trying to face the day I'm lost without you<br />
<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;>If I could only hold you now and make the pain just go away<br />
<br &#47;>Can't stop the tears from running down my face<br />
<br &#47;>Oh<br />
<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;>All I know is I'm lost without you I'm not gonna lie<br />
<br &#47;>How am I going to be strong without you I need you by my side<br />
<br &#47;>If we ever say we'd never be together and we ended with goodbye don't know what I'd do?<br />
<br &#47;>I'm lost without you<br />
<br &#47;>I keep trying to find my way but all I know is I'm lost without you<br />
<br &#47;>I keep trying to face the day and all I know is I'm lost without your love<br />
<br &#47;>I'm lost without you woah<br />
<br &#47;>I'm lost without you<&#47;div><br />
