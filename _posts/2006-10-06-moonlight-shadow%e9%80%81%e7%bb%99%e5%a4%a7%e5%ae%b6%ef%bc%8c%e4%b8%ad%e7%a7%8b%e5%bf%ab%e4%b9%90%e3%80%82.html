<br &#47;>Verse 1<br />
<br &#47;>The last that ever she saw him, carried away by a moonlight shadown,<br />
<br &#47;>He passed on worried and warning, carried away by a moonlight shadown,<br />
<br &#47;>Lost in a riddle that Saturday night, far away on the other side,<br />
<br &#47;>he was caught in the middle of a desperate fight, and she couldn't find how to push through.<br />
<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;>Verse 2<br />
<br &#47;>The trees that whisper in the evening, carried away by a moonlight shadown,<br />
<br &#47;>Sing the song of sorrow and grieving, carried away by a moonlight shadown,<br />
<br &#47;>All she saw was a silhouette of a gun, far away on the other side,<br />
<br &#47;>He was shot six times by a man on the run, and she couldn't find how to push through.<br />
<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;>Verse 3<br />
<br &#47;>Four a.m. in the morning, carried away by a moonlight shadown,<br />
<br &#47;>I watched your vision forming, carried away by a moonlight shadow,<br />
<br &#47;>Star was glowin' in a silvery night, far away on the other side,<br />
<br &#47;>Will you come to talk to me this night, but she couldn't find how to push through.<br />
<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;>Bridge:<br />
<br &#47;>I stay, I pray, I see you in heaven far away,<br />
<br &#47;>I stay, I pray, I see you in heaven one day<br />
<br &#47;><br />
