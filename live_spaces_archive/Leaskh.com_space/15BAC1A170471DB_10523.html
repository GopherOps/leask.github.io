I know I can be a little stubborn sometimes<br />
I must say, a little righteous and too proud<br />
I just want to find a way to compromise<br />
'Cause I believe that we can work things out<br />
<br />
I thought I had all the answers<br />
Never giving in<br />
But baby I was wrong<br />
I admit that I was wrong<br />
<br />
All I know is I'm lost without you<br />
I'm not gonna lie<br />
How am I gonna be strong without you<br />
I need you by my side<br />
<br />
And if we ever said we'll never be together<br />
and we ended it with goodbye<br />
I don't know what I'd do<br />
You know I've been lost without you<br />
<br />
I keep trying to find my way<br />
but all I know is<br />
Im lost without you<br />
I keep trying to face the day<br />
I'm lost without you<br />
<br />
How am I ever gonna get rid of these blues?<br />
Baby i'm so lonely all the time<br />
Everywhere I go I get so confused<br />
You know that you're the only thing that's on my mind<br />
<br />
Oh my bed's so cold at night<br />
I miss you more each day<br />
Only you can make it right<br />
No I'm not too proud to say<br />
<br />
All I know is I'm lost without you<br />
I'm not gonna lie<br />
How am I gonna be strong without you<br />
I need you by my side<br />
<br />
If we ever said we'll never be together<br />
and we ended with goodbye<br />
I don't know what I'd do<br />
You know I've been lost without you<br />
<br />
I keep trying to find my way<br />
And all I know is<br />
I'm lost without you<br />
I keep trying to face the day<br />
I'm lost without you<br />
<br />
If I could only hold you now<br />
Make the pain just go away<br />
Can't stop the tears from running down my face<br />
<br />
Oh<br />
All I know is I'm lost without you<br />
I'm not gonna lie<br />
How am I gonna be strong without you<br />
I need you by my side<br />
<br />
If we ever said we'll never be together<br />
and we ended with goodbye<br />
I don't know what I'd do<br />
You know I've been lost without you<br />
<br />
PS&#58; 又到了分手得季节了，大家保重。</div>
