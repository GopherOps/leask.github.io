<br />Microsoft(R) Firefox 2007 Professional
<br />The new award-winning browser from Microsoft is now faster, securer and quicker anything else on the market. Why use anything else?
<br />
<br />Enjoy a Better Web Experience
<br />MS Firefox 2007 delivers a dramatic boost in the download speeds of online pornography. By utilising a proprietary dynamic algorithm - anything that remotely resembles a tit or a boob will download up to 10 times faster. Fun at the speed of light!
<br />
<br />Stay Secure on the Web
<br />Firefox 2007's new TakeOver(TM) technology protects the Windows Kernel by automatically recognizing all McAfee and Symantec programs as viruses. Downloading has never been safer.
<br />
<br />Interactive Multimedia
<br />Microsoft's AKobe Phlash(TM) Plugin delivers awesome online interactive content; anything from music, videos to games. (Lawsuit from Adobe pending)
